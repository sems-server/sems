# SIPREC (RFC 7865/7866) Session Recording Client configuration

# Session Recording Server URI (required)
# Use sips: scheme for TLS transport (RFC 7866 Section 12.1)
# srs_uri=sip:recorder@192.168.1.100
# srs_uri=sips:recorder@192.168.1.100

# Whether recording is mandatory (reject call if SRS unreachable)
# recording_mandatory=no
#
# Codec for the recording RTP stream sent to the SRS.
# The actual codec is auto-detected from the Communication Session SDP
# when available; this setting is used as a fallback.
# Supported values: PCMA, PCMU
#   PCMA = G.711 A-law (payload type 8, 8000 Hz) - default
#   PCMU = G.711 u-law (payload type 0, 8000 Hz)
# codec=PCMA
#
# RTP transport profile for the Recording Session (RFC 7866 Section 12.2)
# Supported values: RTP/AVP, RTP/AVPF, RTP/SAVP, RTP/SAVPF
#   RTP/AVP   = standard RTP (default)
#   RTP/SAVP  = SRTP (RFC 3711) - MUST be supported per RFC 7866
#   RTP/SAVPF = SRTP with RTCP feedback
#   RTP/AVPF  = RTP with RTCP feedback
# rtp_transport=RTP/AVP
#
# Local RTP port range for SIPREC media (SRC side).
# Ports are allocated in even/odd pairs (RTP/RTCP).
# Must not overlap with SBC RTP relay ports or siprec_srs ports.
# rtp_port_min=50000
# rtp_port_max=50999
